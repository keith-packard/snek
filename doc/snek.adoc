== Acknowledgments

Thanks to Jane Kenney-Norberg for building a science and technology
education program using Lego. Jane taught my kids science in
elementary school and Lego after school, and let me come and play
too. I'm still there helping and teaching, even though my kids are
nearly done with their undergraduate degrees.

Thanks to Christopher Reekie and Henry Gillespie who are both students
and student-teacher in Jane's program and who have helped teach
Arduino programming using Lego robots. Christopher has also been
helping design and test Snek.

== History and Motivations

Teaching computer programming to students in the 10-14 age range
offers some interesting challenges. Graphical languages that
construct programs from elements dragged with a mouse or touch-pad can
be frustratingly slow. Users of these languages don't develop portable skills
necessary for more advanced languages. Sophisticated languages like C,
Java and even Python are so large as to overwhelm the novice with rich
semantics like “objects” and other higher level programming
constructs.

In days long past, beginning programmers were usually presented with
microcomputers running very small languages: BASIC, Forth,
Logo or the like. These languages were not restricted to aid the student, but
because the hosts they ran on were small.

Introductory programming is taught today in a huge range of
environments, from embedded systems to cloud-based systems. Many
of these are technological dead-ends — closed systems that offer no way
even to extract source code, much less to reuse it in another environment.

Some systems, such as Raspberry PI and Arduino, are open — they use
standard languages so that skills learned with them are useful
elsewhere. While the smallest of these machines are similar
in memory and CPU size to those early microcomputers, these smaller
machines are programmed as embedded computers using a full C++
compiler running on a separate desktop or laptop system.

=== Arduino in the Lego Program

I brought Arduino systems into the classroom about five
years ago. The hardware was fabulous and we built a number
of fun robots. After a couple of years, I built some custom
Arduino hardware for our needs.  Our hardware has screw
terminals for the inputs and outputs, a battery pack on the
back and high-current motor controllers to animate the
robots. Because these platforms are Arduino (with an ATmega 328P
processor and a FTDI USB to serial converter) we can use
the stock Arduino development tools.

Students struggled with the complex syntax of Arduino C:
they found it especially hard to type the
obscure punctuation marks and to remember to insert semicolons. I
often heard comments like “this takes too much typing” and “why is it
so picky about semicolons?” The lack of an interactive mode made
experimenting a bit slower than on our Logo systems. In spite of the
difficulties, there have been students who have done interesting
projects in Arduino robotics:

 * Chris Reekie, an 11th-grade student-teacher in the program, took the
   line follower robot design and re-wrote the Arduino firmware to
   include a PID controller algorithm. The results were spectacular,
   with the robot capable of smoothly following a line at high speed.

 * Henry Gillespie, another 11th-grade student-teacher, created a
   robot that automatically measured a person's
   height. This used an optical sensor to monitor movement of a beam as it
   lowered onto the person's head
   and showed measurements on an attached 7-segment display. We've shown
   this device at numerous local Lego shows.

 * Mark Fernandez, an eighth-grade student, built a solar
   energy system that automatically tracked the sun. Mark is
   now a mechanical engineering student at Washington
   University in St Louis.

The hardware was just what we wanted, and a few students
used skills learned in the program later on. However, the
software was not aimed at young students just starting to
write code. Instead of throwing out our existing systems and
starting over, I wondered if we couldn't keep using the same
(hand-made) hardware but improve the programming
environment.

=== A New Language

I searched for a tiny programming language that could run on Arduino
and offer an experience more like Lego Logo. I wanted something that
students could use as a foundation for further computer education and
exploration, something very much like Python.

There is a smaller version of Python, called MicroPython: it
is still a fairly large language which takes a few hundred
kB of ROM and a significant amount of RAM. The language is
also large enough that we couldn't cover it in any detail in
our class time.

I finally decided to just try and write a small
Python-inspired language that could fit on our existing
Arduino Duemilanove compatible hardware.  This machine has:

 * 32kB of Flash
 * 2kB of RAM
 * 1kB of EEPROM
 * 1 serial port hooked to a USB/serial converter
 * 1 SPI port
 * 6 Analog inputs
 * 14 Digital input/output pins

I believe that shrinking the language to a small Python
subset will let the language run on this hardware while also
being simple enough to expose students to the whole language
in a small amount of class time.

=== Introducing Snek

The goals of the Snek language are:

 * *Text-based.* A text-based language offers a richer environment for
   people comfortable with using a keyboard. It is more representative
   of real-world programming than building software using icons and a
   mouse.

 * *Forward-looking.* Skills developed while learning Snek should be
   transferable to other development environments.

 * *Small.* This is not just to fit in smaller devices: the
   Snek language should be small enough to teach in a few
   hours to people with limited exposure to software.

Snek is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write
Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python
programs will not run under Snek.

== A Gentle Snek Tutorial

Before we get into the details of the language, let's pause and just
explore the language a bit to get a flavor of how it works. We won't
be covering anything in detail, nor will all the subtleties be
explored. The hope is to provide a framework for those details.

This tutorial shows what appears on the screen — both what the user
types and what Snek displays. User input is shown *`in bold face,
like this`* on the lines which start with `>` or `+`. Snek output is
shown `in a lighter face, like this` on other lines.

=== Hello World

A traditional exercise in any new language is to get it to print the
words `hello, world` to the console. Because Snek offers an
interactive command line, we can actually do this in several ways.

The first way is to use Snek to echo back what you type at it. Start
up Snek on your computer (perhaps by finding Snek in your system menu
or by typing `snek` at the usual command prompt). When it first
starts, Snek will introduce itself and then wait for you to type
something.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
Welcome to Snek version {revnumber}
>
----

At this `> ` prompt, Snek will print anything you type to it:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *'hello, world'*
'hello, world'
----

Here we see that Snek strings can be enclosed in single
quotes. Strings can also be enclosed in double quotes, which can be
useful if you want to include single quote marks in them. Snek always
prints strings using single quotes, so the output here is the same as
before.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *"hello, world"*
'hello, world'
----

Snek is actually doing something a bit more complicated than echoing
what you type. What you are typing is called an “expression”, and Snek
takes the expression, computes the value that it represents and prints
that out. In this case, the value of either *```'hello, world'```* or
*```"hello, world"```* is `'hello, world'`.

Stepping up a notch, instead of inputting *```'hello, world'```*
directly, we can write a more complicated expression which computes
it:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *'hello,' + ' world'*
'hello, world'
----

At this point, we're using the feature of the interactive environment
which prints out the value of expressions entered. Let's try using the
print function instead:(((print)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *print('hello, world')*
hello, world
----

This time, Snek printed the string without quote marks. That's because
the print function displays exactly what it was given without quote
marks while the command processor prints values in the same format as
they would appear in a program (where you'd need the quote
marks).

****
You might wonder where the value from evaluating the expression
*```print('hello, world')```* is printed. After all, Snek printed the
value of other expressions. The answer is that the `print` function
evaluates to “no value”, and when Snek sees “no value”, it doesn't
print anything. We'll see this happen several more times during the
tutorial.
****

=== Variables

Variables are Snek's way of remembering things. Each variable has a
name, like `moss` or `tree`, and each variable can hold one. You set
(or “assign”) the value of a variable using the `=` operator, and you
get the value by using the name elsewhere:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *moss = 'hello, world'*
> *moss*
'hello, world'
----

Snek creates a variable whenever you assign a value to it
for the first time.

=== Functions

Let's define a function which uses `print` to print `hello world`
and call it. To define a new function in Snek, we use the `def`
keyword like this:(((def)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def hello():*
+     *print('hello, world')*
+ 
> *hello()*
hello, world
----

There's lots of stuff going on here. First, we see how to declare a
function by using the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the
function, followed by the “arguments” in parentheses. We'll talk about
arguments in the next section, <<Simple Arithmetic>>. For now just
type `()`. After the arguments there's a colon.

Colons appear in several places in Snek and (outside of dictionaries)
are used in the same way. After a colon, Snek expects to see a list of
statements. The usual way of including a list of statements is to type
them, one per line, indented from the line containing the colon by a
few spaces. The number of spaces doesn't matter, but each line has to
use the same indentation. When you're done with the list of
statements, you enter a line with the old indentation level.

While entering a list of statements, the command
processor will prompt with `+` instead of `>` to let you know that
it's still waiting for more input before it does anything. A
blank line ends the list of statements for the
`hello` function and gets you back to the regular command prompt.

Finally, we call the new `hello` function and see the results.

Snek normally ends each print operation by moving to
the next line. That's because the print function has a named parameter
called `end` which is set to a newline (`'\n'`) by default. You can change it
to whatever you like, as in:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def hello():*
+     *print('hello', end=',')*
+     *print(' world', end='\n')*
+
> *hello()*
hello, world
----

The first call appends a `,` to the output, while the second call
explicitly appends a newline character, causing the output to move to
the next line. There are a few characters that use this backslash
notation; those are described in the section on <<String Constants>>.

=== Simple Arithmetic

Let's write a function to convert from Fahrenheit temperatures to
Celsius. If you recall, that's:

____
°C = (5/9)(°F - 32)
____

Snek can't use the ° sign in variable names, so we'll just use C and
F:(((return)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *# Convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius*
> *def f_to_c(F):*
+     *return (5/9) * (F - 32)*
+
> *f_to_c(38)*
3.333333
----

The `#` character introduces a comment, which extends to the end of
the line. Anything within a comment is ignored by Snek.

The `f_to_c` function takes one “argument” called `F`. Inside the
function, `F` is a variable which is set to the value you place inside the
parentheses when you call `f_to_c`. In this example, we're
calling `f_to_c` with the value 38. Snek gets the value 38 from `F`
whenever Snek finds it in the function:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
+     *return (5/9) * (F - 32)*
⇒
      return (5/9) * (38 - 32)
⇒
      return 3.333333
----

Snek requires an explicit multiplication operator, `*`, as it doesn't
understand the mathematical convention that adjacent values should be
multiplied. The return statement is how we tell Snek that this
function computes a value that should be given back to the caller.

Numbers in Snek may be written using `_` as a separator, which is
especially useful when writing large numbers.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> # you can write
> c = 299_792_458
> # and Snek will interpret as
> c = 299792458
----
[#for_range]
=== Loops, Ranges and Printing Two Values

Now that we have a function to do this conversion, we can print a
handy reference table for offline use:(((for)))(((in)))(((range)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *# Print a handy conversion table*
> *def f_to_c_table():*
+   *for F in range(0, 100, 10):*
+     *C = f_to_c(F)*
+     *print('%f F = %f C' % (F, C))*
+
> *f_to_c_table()*
0.000000 F = -17.777779 C
10.000000 F = -12.222223 C
20.000000 F = -6.666667 C
30.000000 F = -1.111111 C
40.000000 F = 4.444445 C
50.000000 F = 10.000000 C
60.000000 F = 15.555556 C
70.000000 F = 21.111113 C
80.000000 F = 26.666668 C
90.000000 F = 32.222225 C
----

We see a new statement here: the `for`
statement. This walks over a range of values, assigning the
control variable (`F`, in this case) to each of the values
in the range and then evaluating the list of statements
within it. The `range` function creates the list of values
for `F` by starting at the first value and stepping to just
before the second value. If you give `range` only two
arguments, Snek will step by 1. If you give `range` only one
argument, Snek will use 0 as the starting point.

We need to insert the numeric values into the string shown
by print. Many languages use a special formatted-printing
function to accomplish this. In Snek, there's a more
general-purpose mechanism called “string
interpolation”. String interpolation uses the `%` operator.
Snek walks over the
string on the left and inserts values from the list of values
enclosed in parenthesis on the right wherever there is a `%`
followed by a character. The result of string interpolation
is another string which is then passed to print, which
displays it.

How the values are formatted depends on the character
following the `%` mark; that's discussed in the
<<String Interpolation>> section. How to make that set of
values on the right is discussed in the next section,
<<lists_and_tuples_tutorial>>

[#lists_and_tuples_tutorial]
=== Lists and Tuples

Lists and Tuples in Snek are closely related data types. Both
represent an ordered set of objects. The only difference is that Lists
can be modified after creation while Tuples cannot. We call Lists
“mutable” and Tuples “immutable”. Lists are input as objects separated
by commas and enclosed in square brackets, Tuples are input as objects
separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses:(((List)))(((Tuple)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *[ 'hello,', ' world' ]*
['hello,', ' world']
> *( 'hello,', ' world' )*
('hello,', ' world')
----

Let's assign these to variables so we can explore them in more detail:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *l = [ 'hello,', ' world' ]*
> *t = ( 'hello,', ' world' )*
----

As mentioned earlier, <<lists_and_tuples_tutorial>> are ordered. That means that each
element in a List or Tuple can be referenced by number. This number is
called the index of the element, in Snek, indices start at 0:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *l[0]*
'hello,'
> *t[1]*
' world'
----

Lists can be modified, Tuples cannot:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *l[0] = 'goodbye,'*
> *l*
['goodbye,', ' world']
> *t[0] = 'beautiful'*
<stdin>:5 invalid type: ('hello,', ' world')
----

That last output is Snek telling us that the value
('hello', ' world') cannot be modified.

[#for_list]
We can use another form of the `for` statement to iterate over the
values in a List or Tuple:(((for)))(((in)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def print_list(list):*
+     *for e in list:*
+         *print(e)*
+
> *print_list(l)*
goodbye,
 world
> *print_list(t)*
hello,
 world
----


Similar to the form described in the
<<for_range>> section, this `for` statement
assigns the control variable (`e` in this case) to each of the elements
of the list in turn and evaluates the statements within it.

Lists and Tuples can be concatenated (joined into a single
thing) with the `+` operator:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *['hello,'] + [' world']*
['hello,', ' world']
----

Tuples of one element have a slightly odd syntax, to
distinguish them from expressions enclosed in parentheses: the value
within the Tuple is followed by a comma:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *( 'hello' , ) + ( 'world' , )*
('hello', 'world')

----
=== Dictionaries

Dictionaries are the fanciest data structure in Snek. Like
Lists and Tuples, Dictionaries hold multiple values. Unlike
Lists and Tuples, Dictionaries are not indexed by
numbers. Instead, Dictionaries are indexed by another Snek
value. The only requirement is that the index value be immutable,
so that it can never change. Lists and Dictionaries are the only mutable data
structures in Snek: anything else can be used as a
Dictionary index.(((Dictionary)))

The indexing value in a Dictionary is called the “key”, the indexed
value is called the “value”. Dictionaries are input by enclosing
key/value pairs, separated by commas, inside curly braces:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *{ 1:2, 'hello,' : ' world' }*
{ 'hello,':' world', 1:2 }

----

Note that Snek re-ordered our dictionary. That's because Dictionaries
are always stored in sorted order, and that sorting includes the type
of the keys. Dictionaries can contain only one element with a given
key: you're free to specify dictionaries with duplicate keys, but only
the last value will occur in the resulting Dictionary.

Let's assign our Dictionary to a variable and play with it a bit:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *d = { 1:2, 'hello,' : ' world' }*
> *d[1]*
2
> *d['hello,']*
' world'
> *d[1] = 3*
> *d['goodnight'] = 'moon'*
> *d*
{ 'goodnight':'moon', 'hello,':' world', 1:3 }
> *d[56]*
<stdin>:7 invalid value: 56
----

This example shows creating the Dictionary and assigning it to `d`, then
fetching elements of the dictionary and assigning new values. You can add
elements to a dictionary by using an index that is not already
present. When you ask for an element which isn't present, you get an
error message.

You can also iterate over the keys in a Dictionary using the same ``for``
<<for_list,syntax used above>>. Let's try our print_list function on `d`:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *print_list(d)*
goodnight
hello,
1
----

You can test to see if an element is in a Dictionary using the `in` operator:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *if 1 in d:*
+     *print('yup')*
+ *else:*
+     *print('nope')*
+
yup
> *if 56 in d:*
+     *print('yup')*
+ *else:*
+     *print('nope')*
+
nope
----

=== While

The `for` statement is useful when iterating over a range of
values. Sometimes we want to use more general control flow. We can
rewrite our temperature conversion chart program using a while loop
as follows:(((while)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def f_to_c_table():*
+   *F = 0*
+   *while F < 100:*
+     *C = f_to_c(F)*
+     *print('%f F = %f C' % (F, C))*
+     *F = F + 10*
+
> *f_to_c_table()*
0.000000 F = -17.777779 C
10.000000 F = -12.222223 C
20.000000 F = -6.666667 C
30.000000 F = -1.111111 C
40.000000 F = 4.444445 C
50.000000 F = 10.000000 C
60.000000 F = 15.555556 C
70.000000 F = 21.111113 C
80.000000 F = 26.666668 C
90.000000 F = 32.222225 C
----

This does exactly what the for loop did in the <<for_range>> section:
it first assigns 0 to `F`, then iterates over the statements until `F` is
no longer less than 100.

=== If

`If` statements provide a way of selecting one of many paths of
execution. Each block of statements is preceded by an expression: if
the expression evaluates to `True`, then the following statements are
executed. Otherwise, the next test is tried until the end of the
`if` is reached. Here's a function which measures how many
upper case letters,
lower case letters and digits are in a string:(((if)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def count_chars(s):*
+     *d = 0*
+     *l = 0*
+     *u = 0*
+     *o = 0*
+     *for c in s:*
+         *if '0' <= c and c <= '9':*
+             *d += 1*
+         *elif 'a' <= c and c <= 'z':*
+             *l += 1*
+         *elif 'A' <= c and c <= 'Z':*
+             *u += 1*
+         *else:*
+             *o += 1*
+     *print('digits %d" % d)*
+     *print('lower %d" % l)*
+     *print('upper %d" % u)*
+     *print('other %d" % o)*
+
> *count_chars('4 Score and 7 Years Ago')*
digits 2
lower 13
upper 3
other 5
----

The `elif` statements try other alternatives if previous
`if` tests have not worked. The `else` statement is executed if
all previous `if` and `elif` tests have not worked.

This example also introduces the less-than-or-equal comparison
operator ``\<=`` and demonstrates that ``for v in a`` also works on strings.

=== Controlling GPIOs

General-purpose IO pins, or “GPIOs”, are pins on an embedded processor
which can be controlled by a program running on that processor.

When Snek runs on embedded devices like the Duemilanove or the Metro
M0 Express, it provides functions to directly manipulate these GPIO
pins. You can use either of these, or any other device which uses the
standard Arduino pin numbers, for these examples.(((GPIO)))

==== Turning on the built-in LED

Let's start by turning on the LED which is usually available on
Digital pin 13:(((talkto)))(((on)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto(D13)*
> *on()*
----

Let's get a bit fancier and blink it:(((time.sleep)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto(D13)*
> *while True:*
+     *onfor(.5)*
+     *time.sleep(.5)*
----

==== Hooking up a digital input

Find a bit of wire to connect from Digital pin 1 to GND and let's
control the LED with this primitive switch:(((read)))(((off)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto(D13)*
> *while True:*
+     *if read(D1):*
+         *on()*
+     *else:*
+         *off()*
----

When the wire is connected, the LED turns *off*, and when the wire is
not, the LED turns *on*. That's how simple switches work on
Arduino.

Snek repeatedly reads the input and sets the LED as fast as
it can. This happens thousands of times per second, giving
the illusion that the LED changes the instant the switch
changes.

==== Using an analog input

If you've got a light sensor or potentiometer, you can hook that up to
Analog pin 0 and make the LED track the sensor:(((read)))(((onfor)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto(D13)*
> *while True:*
+     *onfor(1-read(A0))*
+     *time.sleep(1-read(A0))*
----

==== Controlling motors

So far we've only talked about using one pin at a time. Arduino motor
controllers take two pins: one for power and one for direction. Snek
lets you tell it both pins at the same time and then provides separate
functions to set the power and direction. If you have a motor
controller hooked to your board with pin 3 as power and pin
2 as direction you can run the motor at half power and have it alternate
directions with:(((setpower)))(((setleft)))(((setright)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto((3,2))*
> *setpower(0.5)*
> *on()*
> *while True:*
+     *setleft()*
+     *time.sleep(1)*
+     *setright()*
+     *time.sleep(1)*
----

= Snek Reference Manual

The remainder of this book is a reference manual for the Snek
language, including built-in functions and the Snek development environment.

== Lexical Structure

Snek programs are broken into a sequence of tokens by a lexer.
The sequence of tokens is recognized by a parser.

=== Numbers

Snek supports 32-bit floating point numbers and understands the usual
floating point number format:(((Number)))

----
<integer><fraction><exponent>
123.456e+12
----

integer::
A non-empty sequence of decimal digits

fraction::
A decimal point (period) followed by a possibly empty sequence of
decimal digits

exponent::
The letter 'e' or 'E' followed by an optional sign and a non-empty
sequence of digits indicating the exponent magnitude.

All parts are optional, although the number must include at
least one digit in either the integer part or the fraction.

Floating point values (represented internally in IEEE 854
32-bit format) range from approximately `-1.70141e+38` to
`1.70141e+38`. There is 1 sign bit, 8 bits of exponent and 23
stored/24 effective bits of significand (often referred to
as the mantissa). There are two values of infinity (positive and
negative) and a “Not a Number” (NaN) value indicating a
failed computation. Computations using integer
values will generate an error for values which cannot be
represented as a 24-bit integer. That includes values that
are too large and values with fractional components.

=== Names

Names in Snek are used to refer to variables, both global and local to
a particular function. Names consist of an initial letter or
underscore, followed by a sequence of letters, digits, underscore and
period. Here are some valid names:(((Name)))

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
hello
_hello
_h4
math.sqrt
----

And here are some invalid names:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
.hello
4square

----
=== Keywords

Keywords look like regular Snek names, but they are handled specially
by the language and thus cannot be used as names. Here is the list of
Snek keywords:(((Keyword)))

----
and       assert    break     continue
def       del       elif      else
for       global    if        import
in        is        not       or
pass      range     return    while
----

=== Punctuation

Snek uses many special characters to make programs more readable;
separating out names and keywords from operators and other syntax.

        :       ;       ,       (       )       [       ]       {
        }       +       -       *       **      /       //      %
        &       |       ~       ^       <<      >>      =      +=
	-=      *=      **=     /=      //=     %=      &=     |=
	~=      ^=      <<=     >>=     >       !=      <      <=
	==      >=      >       

=== White Space (Spaces and Newlines)

Snek uses indentation to identify program structure. Snek does not
permit tabs to be used for indentation; tabs are invalid characters in
Snek programs. Statements in the same block (list of
statements) are indented the same
amount; statements in deeper blocks are indented more, statements in
shallower blocks less.

When typing Snek directly at the Snek prompt blank lines become
significant, as Snek cannot know what you will type next. You can see
this in the Tutorial, where Snek finishes an indented block at the
blank line.

When loading Snek from a file, blank lines (and lines which contain
only a comment) are entirely ignored; indentation of those lines
doesn't affect the block indentation level. Only lines with Snek
tokens matter in this case.

Spaces in the middle of the line are only significant if they are
necessary to separate tokens; you can insert as many or as few as you
like in other places.

=== String Constants

String constants in Snek are enclosed in either single or double
quotes. Use single quotes to easily include double quotes in the
string, and vice-versa. Strings cannot span multiple lines, but you
can input multiple strings adjacent to one another and they will be
merged into a single string constant in the program.(((String)))

\n::
Newline. Advance to the first column of the next line.

\r::
Carriage Return. Move to the first column on the current line.

\t::
Tab. Advance to the next 'tab stop' in the output. This is usually the
next multiple-of-8 column in the current line.

\xdd::
Hex value. Use two hex digits to represent any character.

\\::
Backslash. Use two backslashes in the input to get one backslash in
the string constant.

Anything else following the backslash is just that
character. In particular:

\"::
Literal double-quote. Useful inside double-quoted strings.

\'::
Literal single-quote. Useful inside single-quoted strings.

=== List and Tuple Constants

List and Tuple constants in Snek are values separated by
commas and enclosed in brackets: square brackets for Lists,
parentheses for Tuples.

Here are some valid Lists:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
[1, 2, 3]
['hello', 'world']
[12]
----

Here are some valid Tuples:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
(1, 2, 3)
('hello', 'world')
(12,)
----

Note the last case — to distinguish between a value in parentheses and
Tuple with one value, the Tuple needs to have a trailing comma. Only
single-valued Tuples are represented with a trailing comma.

=== Dictionary Constants

Dictionaries in Snek are key/value pairs separated by commas and
enclosed in curly braces. Keys are separated from values with a colon.(((Dictionary)))

Here are some valid Dictionaries:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
{ 1:2, 3:4 }
{ 'pi' : 3.14, 'e' : 2.72 }
{ 1: 'one' }
----

You can include entries with duplicate keys: the resulting Dictionary
will contain only the last entry. The order of the entries does not
matter otherwise: the resulting dictionary will always be the same:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *{ 1:2, 3:4 } == { 3:4, 1:2 }*
1
----

When Snek prints dictionaries, they are always printed in the same
order, so two equal dictionaries will have the same string
representation.

== Data Types

Like Python, Snek does not have type declarations. Instead, each value
has an intrinsic representation — any variable may hold a value with
any representation. To keep things reasonably simple, Snek has only a
handful of representation types:

Numbers::
Instead of having integers and floating point values, Snek
represents numbers in floating point as described earlier. Integer
values of less than 24 bits can be represented exactly in these
floating point values: programs requiring precise integer behavior
can still work as long as the values can be held in 24-bits.(((Number)))

Strings::
Strings are just lists of bytes. Snek does not have any intrinsic
support for encodings. Because they are just lists of bytes,
you can store UTF-8 values in them comfortably. Just don't expect
indexing to return Unicode code points.(((String)))

Lists::
Lists are ordered collections of values. You can change the contents of a
list by adding or removing elements. In other languages, these are often
called arrays or vectors. Lists are “mutable” values.(((List)))

Tuples::
Tuples are immutable lists of values. You can't change
a tuple itself once it is created. If any _element_ of
the tuple _is_ mutable, you can modify that element and see the changed results
in the tuple.(((Tuple)))

Dictionaries::
A dictionary is a mapping between *keys* and *values*. They work
somewhat like Lists in that you can store and retrieve values in
them. The index into a Dictionary may be any immutable value, which is
any value other than a List or Dictionary or Tuple containing a List
or Dictionary. Dictionaries are “mutable” values.(((Dictionary)))

Functions::
Functions are values in Snek. You can store them in variables or
lists, and then fetch them later.(((Function)))

Boolean::
Like Python, Snek doesn't have an explicit Boolean type. Instead, a
variety of values work in Boolean contexts as True or False
values. All non-zero Numbers, non-empty
Strings/Lists/Tuples/Dictionaries and all Functions are True. Zero, empty
Strings/Lists/Tuples/Dictionaries are False. The name True is just
another way of typing the number one. Similarly, the name False is
just another way of typing the number zero.(((Boolean)))

[#lists_and_tuples_reference]
=== Lists and Tuples

The ``+=`` operator works a bit different on Lists than any other
type — it appends to the existing list rather than creating a new
list. This can be seen in the following example:(((+=)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *a = [1,2]*
> *b = a*
> *a += [3]*
> *b*
[1, 2, 3]
----

Compare this with Tuples, which (as they are immutable) cannot be
appended to. In this example, ``b`` retains the original Tuple value.
``a`` gets a new Tuple consisting of ``(3,)`` appended to the original
value.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *a = (1,2)*
> *b = a*
> *a += (3,)*
> *b*
(1, 2)
> *a*
(1, 2, 3)
----

== Operators

Operators are things like ``+`` or ``–``. They are part of the
grammar of the language and serve to make programs more readable than
they would be if everything was a function call. Like Python, the
behavior of Snek operators often depends on the values they are
operating on.  Snek includes most of the Python
operators. Some numeric operations work on floating point values,
others work on integer values. Operators which work only on integer
values convert floating point values to integers, and then take the
integer result and convert back to a floating point value.

_value_ ``+`` _value_::
The Plus operator performs addition on numbers or concatenation on
strings, lists and tuples.(((+)))

_value_ ``–`` _value_::
The Minus operator performs subtraction on numbers.(((-)))

_value_ *&#42;* _value_::
The Multiplication operator performs multiplication on numbers. If you
multiply a string, 's', by a number, 'n', you get 'n' copies of 's'
concatenated together.(((*)))

_value_ ``/`` _value_::
The Divide operator performs division on numbers.(((/)))

_value_ ``//`` _value_::
The Div operator performs “integer division” on numbers, producing a
result such that `x // y == floor(x / y)` for all numbers
`x` and `y`.(((//)))

_value_ ``%`` _value_::
The Modulus operator gives the “remainder after division”
of its arguments, such that `x == y * (x // y) + x % y` for
all numbers `x` and `y`.
If the left operand is a string, it performs “interpolation”
with either a single value or a list/tuple of values and is used to
generate formatted output. See the <<String Interpolation>> section
for details.(((%)))

_value_ *&#42;&#42;* _value_::
The Power operator performs exponentiation on numbers.(((**)))

_value_ ``&`` _value_::
The Binary And operator performs bit-wise AND on integers.(((&)))

_value_ ``|`` _value_::
The Binary Or operator performs bit-wise OR on integers.(((|)))

_value_ ``^`` _value_::
The Binary Xor operator performs bit-wise XOR on integers.(((^)))

_value_ ``<<`` _value_::
The Left Shift operator does bit-wise left shift on integers.(((<<)))

_value_ ``>>`` _value_::
The Right Shift operator does bit-wise left shift on integers.(((>>)))

``not`` _value_::
The Boolean Not operator yields True if its argument is False, False
otherwise. That is, if the operand is one of the True values, then Not
returns `False` (which is 0), and if the operand is a `False` value,
then Not returns `True` (which is 1).(((not)))

_a_ ``and`` _b_::
The Boolean And operator first evaluates _a_. If that is False, then its
value is returned. Otherwise, the value of _b_ is returned.(((and)))

_a_ ``or`` _b_::
The Boolean And operator first evaluates _a_. If that is True, then its
value is returned. Otherwise, the value of _b_ is returned.(((or)))

_a_ ``is`` _b_::
True if _a_ and _b_ are the same object.(((is)))

_a_ ``is not`` _b_::
True if _a_ and _b_ are not the same object.(((is not)))

_a_ ``in`` _b_::
True if _a_ is contained in _b_. For strings, this means that _a_ is a
substring of _b_. If _b_ is a tuple or list, this means that _a_ is
one of the elements of _b_. If _b_ is a dictionary, this means
that _a_ is one of the keys of _b_.(((in)))

_a_ ``not in`` _b_::
This is the same as ``not (a in b)``.(((not in)))

``~`` _value_::
The Binary Not operator performs a bit-wise NOT operation on its
integer operand.(((~)))

``–`` _value_::
When used as a unary prefix operator, the Unary Minus operator
performs negation on numbers.(((–)))

``+`` _value_::
When used as a unary prefix operator, the Unary Plus operator
does nothing at all to a number.(((+)))

_value_ ``[`` _index_ ``]``::
The Index operator selects the _index_-th member of strings, lists,
tuples and dictionaries.((([ ])))

``[`` _value_ _[_ ``,`` _value_ … _]_ ``]``::
The List operator creates a new List with the provided members. Note
that a List of one value does not have any comma after the value and
is distinguished from the Index operator solely by how it appears in
the input.((("[value, …]")))

``(`` _value_ ``)``::
Parenthesis serve to control the evaluation order within
expressions. Values inside the parenthesis are computed before they
are used as values for other operators.((("( )")))

``(`` _value_ ``,`` ``)`` or ``(`` _value_ _[_ ``,`` _value_ … _]_ ``)``::
The Tuple operator creates a new Tuple with the provided members. A
Tuple of one value needs a trailing comma so that it can be
distinguished from an expression inside of parenthesis.

``{`` _key_ ``:`` _value_ _[_ ``,`` _key_ ``:`` _value_ … _]_ ``}``::
The Dictionary operator creates a new Dictionary with the provided
key/value pairs. All of the _keys_ must be immutable.((("(value, …)")))

=== Slices

The Slice operator, _value_ ``[`` _base_ ``:`` _bound_ ``:`` _stride_
``]``, extracts a sequence of values from Strings, Lists and Tuples. It
creates a new object with the specified subset of values from the
original. The new object matches the type of the original.(((slice)))

_base_::
The first element of _value_ selected for the slice. If _base_ is
negative, then it counts from the end of _value_ instead the
beginning.

_bound_::
The first element of _value_ beyond the range selected for the slice.

_stride_::
The spacing between selected elements. _Stride_ may be negative, in
which case elements are selected in reverse order, starting towards
the end of _value_ and working towards the beginning. It is an error
for _stride_ to be zero.

All three values are optional. The default value for _stride_ is
one. If _stride_ is positive, the default value for _base_ is 0 and
the default for _bound_ is the length of the array. If _stride_ is
negative, the default value for _base_ is the index of the last
element in _value_ (which is ``len(``_value_``) – 1``) and the default
value for _bound_ is ``–1``. A slice with a single colon is taken
as indicating _base_ and _bound_. Here are some examples:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *# initialize a to a*
> *# Tuple of characters*
> *a = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f')*
> *# With all default values, a[:] looks*
> *# the same as a*
> *a[:]*
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f')
> *# Reverse the Tuple*
> *a[::-1]*
('f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a')
> *# Select the end of the Tuple starting*
> *# at index 3*
> *a[3:]*
('d', 'e', 'f')
> *# Select the beginning of the Tuple,*
> *# ending before index 3*
> *a[:3]*
('a', 'b', 'c')
----

=== String Interpolation

String interpolation in Snek can be confused with formatted printing
in other languages. In Snek, the ``print`` function prints any
arguments as they are given, separating
them with spaces on the line.
String interpolation produces a new String from a format
specification String and a List or Tuple of parameters:
this new String can be used for printing or for anything
else one might want a String for.(((%)))(((string interpolation)))

If only a single value is needed, it need not be enclosed in a List or
Tuple. Beware that if this single value is itself a Tuple or List,
then String interpolation will get the wrong answer.

Within the format specification String are conversion specifiers which
indicate where to insert values from the parameters. These are
indicated with a ``%`` sign followed by a single character:
this character is
the format indicator and specifies how to format the value. The first
conversion specifier uses the first element from the parameters,
etc. The format indicator characters are:

``%d``::
``%i``::
``%o``::
``%x``::
``%X``::
Format a number as a whole number, discarding any fractional part and
without any exponent. ``%d`` and ``%i`` present the value in base 10.
``%o`` uses base 8 (octal) and ``%x`` and ``%X`` use base 16
(hexadecimal), with ``%x`` using lower case letters (a-f) and ``%X``
using upper case letters (A-F).

``%e``::
``%E``::
``%f``::
``%F``::
``%g``::
``%G``::
Format a number as floating point. The upper case variants use ``E``
for the exponent separator, lower case uses ``e`` and are otherwise
identical. ``%e`` always uses exponent notation, ``%f`` never uses
exponent notation. ``%g`` uses whichever notation makes the output smaller.

``%c``::
Output a single character. If the parameter value is a number, it is
converted to the character. If the parameter is a string, the first
character from the string is used.

``%s``::
Output a string. This does not insert quote marks or backslashes.

``%r``::
Generate a printable representation of any value, similar to how the
value would be represented in a Snek program.

If the parameter value doesn't match the format indicator
requirements, or if any other character is used as a format indicator,
then ``%r`` will be used instead.

Here are some examples of String interpolation:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *print('hello %s' % 'world')*
hello world
> *print('hello %r' % 'world')*
hello 'world'
> *print('pi = %d' % 3.1415)*
pi = 3
> *print('pi = %f' % 3.1415)*
pi = 3.141500
> *print('pi = %e' % 3.1415)*
pi = 3.141500e+00
> *print('pi = %g' % 3.1415)*
pi = 3.1415
> *print('star is %c' % 42)*
star is *
> *print('%d %d %d' % (1, 2, 3))*
1 2 3
----

And here are a couple of examples showing why a single value may need
to be enclosed in a Tuple:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *a = (1,2,3)*
> *print('a is %r' % a)*
a is 1
> *print('a is %r' % (a,))*
a is (1, 2, 3)
----

In the first case, String interpolation is using the first element of
``a`` as the value instead of using all of ``a``.

== Expression and Assignment Statements

_value_::
An Expression statement simply evaluates _value_.  This can be useful
if _value_ has a side-effect, like a function call that sets some
global state. At the top-level, _value_ is printed, otherwise it is
discarded.

_location_ ``=`` _value_::
The Assignment statement takes the value on the right operand and stores it in
the location indicated by the left operand. The left operand may be a
variable, a list location or a dictionary location.(((assignment)))(((=)))

_location_ ``+=``, ``–=``, ``*=``, ``/=``, ``//=``, ``%=``, ``**=``, ``&=``, ``|=``, ``^=``, ``<\<=``, ``>>=`` _value_::
The Operation Assignment statements take the value of the left operand and
the value of the right operand and performs the operation indicated by
the operator. Then it stores the result back in the location indicated
by the left operand. There are some subtleties about this which are
discussed in the <<lists_and_tuples_reference>> section of the <<Data Types>> chapter.
(((+=)))(((–=)))(((*=)))(((/=)))(((//=)))(((%=)))(((**=)))(((&=)))(((|=)))(((^=)))(((<\<=)))(((>>=))) 

== Control Flow

Snek has a subset of the Python control flow operations, including
trailing ``else:`` blocks for loops.

=== `if`

____
`if` _value_ `:` block _[_ `elif` _value_ `:` … _] [_  `else:` block _]_
____

An If statement contains an initial `if` block, any number of `elif`
blocks and then (optionally) an `else` block in the following
structure:(((if)))(((elif)))(((else)))

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
if if_value :
    if statements
elif elif_value :
    elif_statements
…
else:
    else_statements
----

If _if_value_ is true, then _if_statements_ are executed. Otherwise,
if _elif_value_ is true, then _elif_statements_ are executed. If none
of the if or elif values are true, then the _else_statements_ are
executed.

=== `while`
____
`while` _value_ `:` block _[_ `else:` block _]_
____

A While statements consists of a `while` block followed by an optional
`else` block:(((while)))(((else)))

[source,subs="normal+"]
----
while while_value :
    block
else:
    block
----

_While_value_ is evaluated and if it evaluates as `True`, the
while block is executed. Then the system evaluates _while_value_
again, and if it evaluates as `True` again, the while block is
again executed. This continues until the _while_value_ evaluates as
`False`.

When the _while_value_ evaluates as `False`, the `else:` block
is executed. If a `break` statement is executed as a part of the
while statements, then the program immediately jumps past the else
statements. If a `continue` statement is executed as a part of the
`while` statements, execution jumps back to the evaluation of
_while_value_. The `else:` portion (with else statements) is optional.(((break)))

=== `for`
____
`for` _name_ `in` _value_ `:` block _[_ `else:` block _]_
____

For each value `v` in the list of _values_, the `for`
statement assigns `v` to _name_ and
then executes a block of statements. _Value_ can be specified in two
different ways: as a List, Tuple, Dictionary or String values, or
as a range expression involving numbers:(((for)))(((else)))

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
for name in value:
    for statements
else:
    else statements
----

In this case, the _value_ must be a List,
Tuple, Dictionary or String. For Lists and Tuples, the values are the
elements of the object. For Strings, the values are strings
made from each
separate (ASCII) character in the string. For Dictionaries, the values are the
keys in the dictionary.

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
for name in range ( start, stop, step ):
    for statements
else:
    else statements
----

In this form, the `for` statement assigns a range of numeric values
to _name_. Starting with _start_, and going while not beyond _stop_,
_name_ gets _step_ added at each iteration. _Start_ is optional; if
not present, 0 will be used. _Step_ is also optional; if not present,
1 will be used.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *for x in (1,2,3):*
+     *print(x)*
+ 
1
2
3
> *for c in 'hi':*
+     *print(c)*
+ 
h
i
> *a = { 1:2, 3:4 }*
> *for k in a:*
+     *print('key is %r value is %r' % (k, a[k]))*
+ 
key is 1 value is 2
key is 3 value is 4
> *for i in range(3):*
+     *print(i)*
+ 
0
1
2
> *for i in range(2, 10, 2):*
+     *print(i)*
+ 
2
4
6
8
----

If a `break` statement is executed as a part of the `for`
statements, then the program immediately jumps past the else
statements. If a `continue` statement is executed as a part of the
`for` statements, execution jumps back to the assignment of the next
value to _name_. In both forms, the `else:` portion (with else
statements) is optional.(((break)))

=== `return` _value_
The Return statement causes the currently executing function 
immediately evaluate to _value_ in the enclosing context.(((return)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def r():*
+     *return 1*
+     *print('hello')*
+ 
> *r()*
1
----

In this case, the `print` statement did not execute because the
`return` happened before it.

=== `break`
The Break statement causes the closest enclosing `while` or `for` statement to
terminate. Any optional `else:` clause associated with the `while` or `for`
statement is skipped when the `break` is executed.(((break)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *for x in (1,2):*
+     *if x == 2:*
+         *break*
+     *print(x)*
+ *else:*
+     *print('else')*
+ 
1
----


[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *for x in (1,2):*
+     *if x == 3:*
+         *break*
+     *print(x)*
+ *else:*
+     *print('else')*
+ 
1
2
else
----

In this case, the first example does not print `else` due to the
`break` statement execution rules. The second example prints `else`
because the `break` statement is never executed.

=== `continue`
The `continue` statement causes the closest enclosing `while` or `for`
statement to jump back to the portion of the loop which evaluates the
termination condition. In `while` statements, that is where the
_while_value_ is evaluated. In `for` statements, that is where
the next value in the sequence is computed.(((continue)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *vowels = 0*
> *other = 0*
> *for a in 'hello, world':*
+     *if a in 'aeiou':*
+         *vowels += 1*
+         *continue*
+     *other += 1*
+ 
> *vowels*
3
> *other*
9
----

The `continue` statement skips the execution of `other += 1`,
otherwise `other` would be `12`.

=== `pass`
The `pass` statement is a place-holder that does nothing and can
be used any place a statement is needed when no execution is desired.(((pass)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *if 1 != 2:*
+     *pass*
+ *else:*
+     *print('equal')*
+
----

This example ends up doing nothing as the condition directs execution
through the `pass` statement.

== Other Statements

=== `import` _name_

The Import statement is ignored and is part of Snek so that Snek programs can
be run using Python.(((import)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *import curses*
----

=== `global` _name_ _[_ `,` _name_ … _]_

The Global statement marks the names as non-local; assignment to them
will not cause a new variable to be created.(((global)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *g = 0*
> *def set_local(v):*
+     *g = v*
+ 
> *def set_global(v):*
+     *global g*
+     *g = v*
+ 
>  *set_local(12)*
> *g*
0
> *set_global(12)*
> *g*
12
> 
----

Because `set_local` does not include `global g`, the assignment to `g`
creates a new local variable, which is then discarded when the
function returns. `set_global` does include the `global g` statement,
so the assignment to `g` references the global variable and the change
is visible after that function finishes.

=== `del`  _location_

The Del statement deletes either variables or elements within a List
or Dictionary.(((del)))

=== `assert`  _value_

If _value_ is `False`, the program will print `AssertionError` and
then stop. Otherwise, the program will continue executing. This is
useful to add checks inside your program to help catch problems
earlier.

== Functions

Functions in Snek (as in any language) provide a way to encapsulate a
sequence of operations. They can be used to help document what a
program does, to shorten the overall length of a program or to hide
the details of an operation from other parts of the program.

Functions take a list of “positional” parameters, then a list of
“named” parameters. Positional parameters are all required, and are
passed in the caller in the same order they appear in the
declaration. Named parameters are optional; they will be set to the
provided default value if not passed by the caller. They can appear in
any order in the call. Each of these parameters is assigned to a
variable in a new scope; variables in this new scope will hide global
variables and variables from other functions with the same name. When
the function returns, all variables in this new scope are discarded.

Additional variables in this new scope are created when they are
assigned to, unless they are included in a `global` statement.(((def)))

=== `def`

`def` _fname_ `(` _pos1 [_ `,` _posn … ] [_ `,` _namen_ `=` _defaultn … ]_ `) :` block

A `def` statement declares (or re-declares) a function. The positional
and named parameters are all visible as local variables while the
function is executing.

Here's an example of a function with two parameters:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def subtract(a,b):*
+     *return a - b*
+
> *subtract(3,2)*
1
----

And here's a function with one positional parameter and two named
parameters:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *def step(value, times=1, plus=0):*
+     *return value * times + plus*
+
> *step(12)*
12
> *step(12, times=2)*
24
> *step(12, plus=1)*
13
> *step(12, times=2, plus=1)*
25
----

== Standard Built-in Functions

Snek includes a small set of standard built-in functions, but it may
be extended with a number of system-dependent functions as well. This
chapter describes the set of builtin functions which are considered a
“standard” part of the Snek language and are provided in all Snek
implementations.

=== `len(value)`

Len returns the number of characters for a String or the number of
elements in a Tuple, List or Dictionary(((len)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *len('hello, world')*
12
> *len((1,2,3))*
3
> *len([1,2,3])*
3
> *len({ 1:2, 3:4, 5:6, 7:8 })*
4
----

=== `print(` _value1_ `, `_value2_`, …, `end='\n')`

Print writes all of its positional parameters to the console
separated by spaces (`' '`) followed by the `end` named
parameter (default: `'\n'`).(((print)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *print('hello world', end='.')*
hello world.> 
> *print('hello', 'world')*
hello world
> 
----

=== `sys.stdout.flush()`

Flush output to the console, in case there is buffering somewhere.
(((sys.stdout.flush)))

=== `ord(` _string_ `)`

Converts the first character in a string to its ASCII value.(((ord)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *ord('A')*
65
----

=== `chr(` _number_ `)`

Converts an ASCII value to a one character string.(((chr)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *chr(65)*
'A'
----

=== `abs(` _number_ `)`
Computes the absolute value of its numeric argument. The absolute
value of a number is the number's distance from 0.(((abs)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *abs(-2)*
2
----

=== `math.sqrt(` _number_ `)`
Compute the square root of its numeric argument.(((math.sqrt)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *math.sqrt(2)*
1.414214
----

== Common System Functions

These functions are system-dependent, but are generally available. If
they are available, they will work as described here.

=== `exit(` _value_ `)`

Terminate Snek and return _value_ to the operating system. How that
value is interpreted depends on the operating system. On
Posix-compatible systems, _value_ should be a number which forms the
exit code for the Snek process with zero indicating success and
non-zero indicating failure.(((exit)))

=== `time.sleep(` _seconds_ `)`

Pause for the specified amount of time (which can include a fractional
part).(((time.sleep)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *time.sleep(1)*
> 
----

=== `time.monotonic()`

Return the time (in seconds) since some unspecified reference point in
the system history. This time always increases, even if the system
clock is adjusted (hence the name). Because Snek uses single-precision
floating point values for all numbers, the reference point will be
close to the starting time of the Snek system, so values may be quite
small.(((time.monotonic)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *time.monotonic()*
6.859814
----

=== `random.seed(` _seed_ `)`

Re-seeds the random number generator with `seed`. The random number
generator will always generate the same sequence of numbers if started
with the same `seed`.(((random.seed)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *random.seed(time.monotonic())*
> 
----

=== `random.randrange(` _max_ `)`

Generates a random integer between 0 and max-1 inclusive.(((random.randrange)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *random.randrange(10)*
3
----

== Input Functions

The Snek Input functions provide some operations commonly required
when reading data provided by the user via the serial port.

=== `float(` _value_ `)`

Converts _value_ into a number. _value_ can be either a string or a
number.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *float('10.25')*
10.25
----

=== `input(` _prompt_ `)`

Prints _prompt_ and then waits for the user to enter some text,
terminated with a newline. The text, without the trailing newline, is
returned.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *input('--> ')*
--> *Hi there*
'Hi there'
----

==== `int(` _value_ `)`

Converts _value_ into an integer, rounding towards zero. _value_ can
be either a string or a number.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *int('10.75')*
10
> *int(-10.75)*
-10
----

==== `str(` _value_ `)`

Converts _value_ (which may be any snek value) into a string. This is
the same as `'%s' % (`_value_`, )`, but may be more clear in some
contexts.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *str(10.75)*
'10.75'
> *str((1,2,3))*
'(1, 2, 3)'
> *str('hello world')
'hello world'
----

== Math Functions

== GPIO Functions

On embedded devices, Snek has a range of functions designed to make
manipulating the GPIO pins convenient. Snek keeps track of two pins
for output and one pin for input. The two output pins are called Power
and Direction. Each output function specifies which pins it operates
on. All input and output values range between 0 and 1. Digital pins
use only 0 or 1, analog pins support the full range of values from 0
to 1.(((GPIO)))

Input pins can be set so that they read as 0 or 1 when nothing is
connected by using `pulldown` or `pullup`. Using `pullnone` makes the
pin “float” to provide accurate analog readings. Digital pins are
to `pullup` by default, Analog pins are set to `pullnone`.

Output pins are either *on* or *off*. A pin which is *on* has its
value set to the current power for that pin; changes to the current
power for the pin are effective immediately. A pin which is *off* has
its output set to zero, but Snek remembers the `setpower` level and will
restore the pin to that level when it is turned *on*.

=== `talkto(` _pin_ `)`

Set the current output pins. If _pin_ is a number, this sets both the
Power and Direction pins. If _pin_ is a List or Tuple, then the first
element sets the Power pin and the second sets the Direction pin.(((talkto)))

=== `setpower(` _power_ `)`

Sets the power level on the current Power pin to _power_. If the Power
pin is currently *on*, then this is effective
immediately. Otherwise, Snek remembers the desired power level and
will use it when the pin is turned *on*. Values less than zero set the
power to zero, values greater than one set the power to one.(((setpower)))

=== `setleft()`

Turns the current Direction pin *on*.(((setleft)))

=== `setright()`

Turns the current Direction pin *off*.(((setright)))

=== `on()`

Turns the current Power pin *on*.(((on)))

=== `off()`

Turns the current Power pin *off*.(((off)))

=== `onfor(` _seconds_ `)`

Turns the current Power pin *on*, delays for _seconds_ and then
turns the current Power pin *off*.(((onfor)))

=== `read(` _pin_ `)`

Returns the value of _pin_. If this is an analog pin, then `read`
returns a value from `0 to 1` (inclusive). If this a digital pin, then
`read` returns either `0` or `1`.(((read)))

=== `pullnone(` _pin_ `)`

Removes any `pullup` or `pulldown` settings for _pin_, leaving the
value floating when nothing is connected. Use this setting on analog
pins to get continuous values rather than just 0 or 1. This is the
default setting for Analog pins.

=== `pullup(` _pin_ `)`

Assigns a `pullup` setting for _pin_, so that the `read` will return 1
when nothing is connected. When in this mode, analog pins will return
only 0 or 1. This is the default setting for Digital pins.

=== `pulldown(` _pin_ `)`

Assigns a `pullup` setting for _pin_, so that the `read` will return 0
when nothing is connected. When in this mode, analog pins will return
only 0 or 1. Note that some boards do not support this mode, in which
case this function will not be available.

=== `stopall()`

Turns all pins off.(((stopall)))

=== `neopixel(` _pixels_ `)`

Programs either a set of neopixel devices connected to the current
Power pin (when Power and Direction are the same) or a set of APA102
devices connected to the current Power (used for APA102 Data) and
Direction (used for APA102 Clock) pins (when Power and Direction are
different). _pixels_ is a list or tuple, each element of which is a
list or tuple of three numbers ranging from 0 to 1 for the desired
red, green and blue intensity of the target neopixel.(((neopixel)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto(NEOPIXEL)*
> *pixels = [(0.33, 0, 0), (0, 0.66, 0), (0, 0, 1)]*
> *neopixel(pixels)*
----

This example programs three NeoPixel devices, the first one is set to
one third intensity red, the second to two thirds intensity green and
the last to full intensity blue. If there are additional neopixel
devices connected, they will not be modified. If there are fewer
devices connected than the data provided, the extra values will be
ignored.

=== `tone(` _frequency_ `)`

On devices with an audio output, this sets the output of that pin to a
sine wave at _frequency_ Hertz. The amplitude is controlled by the
power setting for the pin and whether the pin is turned `on`.(((tone)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto(A0)*
> *on()*
> *tone(tone.A)*
----

=== `tonefor(` _frequency_ `,` _seconds_ `)`

Sets the audio tone to _frequency_, turns the current Power pin *on*,
delays for _seconds_ and then turns the current Power pin
*off*.(((tonefor)))

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
> *talkto(A0)*
> *tonefor(tone.C, 1)*
----

=== Musical note constants

These provide frequencies commonly used in music, starting with middle
C:

== EEPROM built-in functions

Snek on embedded devices may include persistent storage for source
code. This code is read at boot time, allowing boards with Snek loaded
to run stand-alone. These functions are used by Snekde to get and put
programs to the device.(((eeprom)))

=== `eeprom.write()`

Reads characters from the console and writes them to eeprom until a `^D`
character is read.(((eeprom.write)))

=== `eeprom.show()`

Dumps the current contents of eeprom out to the console. If a
parameter is passed to this function then a `^B` character is sent
before the text, and a `^C` is sent afterwards. Snekde uses this feature
to accurately capture the program text when the Get command is
invoked.(((eeprom.show)))

=== `eeprom.load()`

Re-parses the current eeprom contents, just as Snek does at boot time.(((eeprom.load)))

=== `eeprom.erase()`

Erase the eeprom.(((eeprom.erase)))

=== `reset()`

Restart the Snek system, erasing all RAM contents. As part of the
restart process, Snek will re-read any source code stored in eeprom.(((reset)))

== Temperature Conversion Function

This function is included in devices that have a built-in temperature
sensor.

=== `temperature(` _sensorvalue_ `)`

The conversion function is pre-set with the parameters needed
to convert from the temperature sensor value to degrees Celsius.

== Curses built-in functions

Curses provides a simple mechanism for displaying text on the
console. The API is designed to be reasonably compatible with the
Python curses module, although it is much less flexible. Snek only
supports ANSI terminals, and doesn't have any idea what the dimensions
of the console are. Not all Snek implementations provide the curses
functions.(((curses)))

=== `curses.initscr()`

Puts the console into “visual” mode. Disables echo. Makes `stdscr.getch()` stop
waiting for newline.(((curses.initscr)))

=== `curses.endwin()`

Resets the console back to “normal” mode. Enables echo. Makes
`stdscr.getch()` wait for newlines.(((curses.endwin)))

=== `curses.noecho()`, `curses.echo()`, `curses.cbreak()`, `curses.nocbreak()`

All four of these functions are no-ops and are part of the API solely
to make it more compatible with Python curses.(((curses.noecho)))(((curses.echo)))(((curses.cbreak)))(((curses.nocbreak)))

=== `stdscr.nodelay(` _nodelay_ `)`

If _nodelay_ is True, then `stdscr.getch()` will return -1 if there
is no character waiting. If _nodelay_ is False, the `stdscr.getch()`
will block waiting for a character to return.(((stdscr.nodelay)))

=== `stdscr.erase()`

Erase the screen.(((stdscr.erase)))

=== `stdscr.addstr(` _row_ `,` _column_ `,` _string_ `)`

Displays _string_ at _row_, _column_. _Row_ `0` is the top row of the
screen. _Column_ `0` is the left column. The cursor is left at the end
of the string.(((stdscr.addstr)))

=== `stdscr.move(` _row_ `,` _column_ `)`

Moves the cursor to _row_, _column_ without displaying anything there.(((stdscr.move)))

=== `stdscr.refresh()`

Flushes any pending screen updates.(((stdscr.refresh)))

=== `stdscr.getch()`

Reads a character from the console input. Returns a number indicating
the character read, which can be converted to a string using
`chr(c)`. If `stdscr.nodelay(nodelay)` was most recently called
with _nodelay_ `= True`, then `stdscr.getch()` will immediately
return -1 if no characters are pending.(((stdscr.getch)))

== Snek Development Environment

The Snek Development Environment, Snekde, is a Python program which runs
on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows to work with small devices running
Snek, such as the Duemilanove and Metro M0 Express boards.(((snekde)))

=== Starting Snekde

On Windows and Linux, launch `snekde` from your application menu. On Mac OS
X, Snekde is installed along with the other Snek files in the Snek
folder inside your personal Applications folder, which is
inside your Home folder. Double click on the Snekde icon to launch.

Snekde runs inside a console or terminal window and doesn't use the
mouse at all, instead it is controlled entirely using keyboard
commands.

Snekde splits the window into two panes. The upper pane is the
”editor pane” that holds your Snek program. The lower pane is the
“console pane” and handles communications with the Snek device.

=== Basic Navigation

Across the top of the window you'll see a list of commands which are
bound to function keys. Those are there to remind you how to control
Snekde.

If your function keys don't work, you can use the Esc key
along with a number key instead. Press and release the Esc key, then
press and release a number key. For instance, to invoke the F1
command, press and release Esc, then press and release '1'.

Between the two panes is a separator line. At the end of that line is
the name of the currently connected Snek device, such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`
on Linux or `COM12` on Windows. If there isn't a device connected, it
will say “<no device>”.

The cursor shows which pane you are currently working with. To switch
between the editor and console panes, use the F7 key. If you don't
have one of these, or if it doesn't work, you can also use Esc-7 or
Ctrl-o (press and hold the Ctrl key, press the `o` key and then
release both).

You can move around the current pane with the arrow, home, end and
page-up/page-down keys. Cut/paste/copy use Ctrl-x, Ctrl-v and Ctrl-c
or Esc-x, Esc-v and Esc-c respectively. To mark a section of text for
a Cut or Paste command, press Esc-space or Ctrl-space then use regular
movement commands. The selected region of text will be highlighted.

=== Connecting to a Device

To connect to a device running Snek, press the F1 key (usually right
next to the ESC key on your keyboard). That will display a dialog box
in the middle of the screen listing all of the devices which might be
running Snek (if you've got a serial modem or other similar device,
that will also be listed here). Select the target device and press the
ENTER key.

Don't expect anything to happen in the lower pane just yet; you'll
have to get the attention of the device first.

Switch to the Console pane (F7) and press Ctrl-c to interrupt any
currently running Snek program. You should see the Snek prompt (“> ”)
appear in the pane.

=== Getting and Putting Programs to a Device

The Snek device holds one program in non-volatile memory. When it
starts up, it will run that program automatically. This lets you set
up the device so that it will perform some action when it is turned on
without needing to communicate with it first.

The Get command fetches the current program from the connected device
and puts it into the Editor pane. The Put command writes the Editor
pane contents into non-volatile memory in the target device and then
restarts the target device to have it reload the program. Both of
these commands will interrupt any running Snek program before doing
any work.

=== Loading and Saving Programs to the Host

You can also save and load programs to the host file system. Both of
these commands prompt for a filename using a file dialog. At the top
of the dialog is the filename to use. The rest of the dialog contains
directories and files within the same directory as the
filename. Directories are enclosed in `[` `]`.

Using the arrow keys replaces the filename with the highlighted
name. You can also edit the filename using backspace and entering a
new name.

Select a filename by pressing enter. If the name is a directory,
then the contents of that directory will replace the list of
directories and files in the dialog. If the name is a file, then that
will be used for the load or save operation.

To quit from the dialog and skip loading or saving a file, press Escape.

= Snek on snekboard

Snek for the snekboard includes the Common System, Math, Input, GPIO
(including the `neopixel` function) and EEPROM fountain's. Snek for the
snekboard provides pre-defined variables for the eight analog I/O pins
as well as the four 9V motor controllers:(((snekboard)))

A1-A8::
Analog input and output pins. When used as output pins, you can use
setpower to control the drive power. When used as input pins, Snek
will return a value from 0-1 indicating the ratio of the pin voltage
to 3.3V. By default, when used as input pins, Snek does not apply
either a pull-up or pull-down resistor to the pin so that a
disconnected pin will read an indeterminate value. Change this using
`pullnone`, `pullup` or `pulldown` functions.

M1-M4::
Bi-directional 9V DC motor control, 2.5A max current. These are tuples
with two values each. `M1[0]`, `M2[0]`, `M3[0]` and `M4[0]` are the
power pins. `M1[1]`, `M2[1]`, `M3[1]` and `M4[1]` are the direction
pins. Note that there's a bit of firmware behind these pins that keeps
the outputs from changing power too rapidly.

NEOPIXEL::
The two APA102 devices on the board, which can be driven using the
`neopixel` function.

Snekboard includes a boot loader which
presents as a USB mass storage device with a FAT file system. You can
get the board into this mode by connecting the board to your computer
over USB and then pressing the blue reset button twice in quick
succession.

Then, find the `snek-board-{version}.uf2` file included in the Snek
package for your machine and copy it to the snekboard file system.

= Snek on Arduino Duemilanove, LilyPad, Nano and Uno

These boards are all based on the original Arduino ATMega 328
processor. There are two versions of Snek for these boards: the
regular version and a “big” version. The regular version co-exists
with the Optiboot bootloader which makes re-flashing with new versions
of Snek convenient. The big version overwrites the boot loader to
provide additional functionality.

Snek for these boards include the Common System, EEPROM, and GPIO
functions. The “big” versions add the Input functions. They do not
include the Math functions, nor the `pulldown` function. Snek for
these boards provides pre-defined variables for all of the GPIO
pins:(((Duemilanove)))(((LilyPad)))(((Nano)))(((Uno)))(((Arduino)))

Snek for the LilyPad adds the 'tone' and 'tonefor' builtins, which
send an audio tone to pin D5. To make space for this, support for
Dictionaries was removed.

D0 - D13::
Digital input and output pins. By default, when used as input pins,
Snek applies a pull-up resistor to the pin so that a disconnected pin
will read as 1. Change this using `pullnone` or `pullup` functions.

A0 - A5::
Analog input and Digital output pins. When used as input pins, Snek
will return a value from 0-1 indicating the ratio of the pin voltage
to 5V. By default, when used as input pins, Snek does not apply
either a pull-up or pull-down resistor to the pin so that a
disconnected pin will read an indeterminate value. Change this using
`pullnone` or `pullup` functions.

=== Installing Optiboot on ATMega 328 boards

Snek nearly fills the ATMega 328P flash, leaving space only for the
smaller optiboot loader. This loader is not usually installed on the
Duemilanove or Nano, so you'll need to install it by hand using a
programming puck, such as the USBTiny device.

Use the Arduino IDE to install the Optiboot boot loader following
instructions found on the
link:https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot[Optiboot web site].

=== Installing Snek on ATMega 328 boards

To install the regular version, once your board is ready to install
snek, you can use avrdude to do that with Optiboot. On Linux, you can
use snek-duemilanove-install (for Duemilanove and Nano),
snek-uno-install (for Uno), or snek-lilypad-install (for LilyPad).

	$ snek-duemilanove-install

or

	$ snek-lilypad-install

or

	$ snek-uno-install

On other hosts, you'll need to run 'avrdude' manually. For Duemilanove or Nano boards:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes,"]
----
$ avrdude -pATMEGA328P -carduino -PCOM1 -b115200 -D -U flash:w:snek-duemilanove-{version}.hex:i
----

For Uno boards:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes,"]
----
$ avrdude -pATMEGA328P -carduino -PCOM1 -b115200 -D -U flash:w:snek-uno-{version}.hex:i
----

For LilyPad boards:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes,"]
----
$ avrdude -pATMEGA328P -carduino -PCOM1 -b57600 -D -U flash:w:snek-lilypad-{version}.hex:i
----

Replace 'COM1' with the name of the serial port on your computer.

To install the “big” version, you'll need to use a programming device,
such as a usbtiny from Adafruit. Once connected, on Linux you can use
snek-duemilanove-big-install (for Duemilanove or Nano boards) or
snek-uno-big-install (for Uno boards):

	$ snek-duemilanove-big-install

or

	$ snek-uno-install-big-install

On other hosts, you'll need to run 'avrdude' manually:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes,"]
----
$ avrdude -V -c usbtiny -p m328 -u -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0x91:m -U efuse:w:0xfd:m
$ avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328 -U flash:w:snek-duemilanove-big-{version}.hex:i
----

or

[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes,"]
----
$ avrdude -V -c usbtiny -p m328 -u -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0x91:m -U efuse:w:0xfd:m

= Snek on Adafruit ItsyBitsy and the Crowd Supply µduino

Snek for the ItsyBitsy and µduino includes the Common System, GPIO
(without the `neopixel` function), and EEPROM
functions. Snek for the itsybitsy provides pre-defined
variables for all of the the GPIO pins:(((ItsyBitsy)))(((µduino)))

D0 - D13::
Digital input and output pins. By default, when used as input pins,
Snek applies a pull-up resistor to the pin so that a disconnected pin
will read as 1. Change this using `pullnone`, `pullup` or `pulldown`
functions.

A0 - A5::
Analog input and Digital output pins. When used as input pins, Snek
will return a value from 0-1 indicating the ratio of the pin voltage
to either 3.3V (on the 3v device) or 5V (on the 5V device).  By
default, when used as input pins, Snek does not apply either a pull-up
or pull-down resistor to the pin so that a disconnected pin will read
an indeterminate value. Change this using `pullnone`, `pullup` or
`pulldown` functions.

MISO, MOSI, SCK::
Additional digital input and output pins. These work just like
D0-D13. These are not present on the µduino board.

Snek fills the ATMega 32u4 flash completely leaving no space for the
usual USB boot loader, so installing Snek requires a programming
puck, such as the USBTiny device.

On Linux, the Snek installation includes shell scripts,
snek-itsybitsy-install and snek-uduino-install which install the
binary using 'avrdude'. Read the snek-itsybitsy-install or
snek-uduino-install manual (also included in the installation) for
more information.

The µduino programming wires are only available while the device is
still connected to the carrier board. Normally the µduino has been
broken off of that during manufacturing.

On other hosts, you'll need to install 'avrdude'. Once you've done that, there
are two steps to getting Snek installed on the device.

 1. Set the 'fuses' on the target device. This sets the start address
    back to the beginning of memory instead of the boot loader, and
    then has the device leave the eeprom contents alone when
    re-flashing. That means you won't lose your Snek program when
    updating the firmware.

[source]
$ avrdude -F -V -c usbtiny -p m32u4 -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0x91:m -U efuse:w:0xfd:m
+
 2. Install the Snek binary. Pick the version for your board as that
    also sets the right clock speed. For 5v boards, install the 5v binary:
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
$ avrdude -F -V -c usbtiny -p m32u4 -U flash:w:snek-itsybitsy5v-{version}.hex
+
for 3v boards, use the 3v binary.
+
[source,subs="attributes+"]
$ avrdude -F -V -c usbtiny -p m32u4 -U flash:w:snek-itsybitsy3v-{version}.hex

for µduino boards, use the µduino binary.

Digital input and output pins. By default, when used as input pins,
Snek applies a pull-up resistor to the pin so that a disconnected pin
will read as 1. Change this using `pullnone`, `pullup` or `pulldown`
functions.  D5 on the ItsyBitsy M0 is hooked to a 3.3V to 5V converter
so that it can drive 5V devices. This means it cannot be used as an
input pin.

A0::
Analog input and output pin. This pin has a digital-to-analog converter
(DAC). When used as input pins, Snek
will return a value from 0-1 indicating the ratio of the pin voltage
to 3.3V.  By default, when used as input pins, Snek does not apply
either a pull-up or pull-down resistor to the pin so that a
disconnected pin will read an indeterminate value. Change this using
`pullnone`, `pullup` or `pulldown` functions.

SDA, SCL, MISO, MOSI, SCK::
Additional digital input and output pins. These work just like D0-D13.

NEOPIXEL::
The APA102 device on the board, which can be driven using the
`neopixel` function.

The Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 board includes a boot loader which presents
as a USB mass storage device with a FAT file system. You can get the
board into this mode by connecting the board to your computer over USB
and then pressing the reset button twice in succession. In boot loader
mode, the red LED on D13 will pulse rapidly for a few seconds, then
more slowly. At that point, the APA102 device will turn green.

Once the ItsyBitsy M0 is in boot loader mode and has been mounted,
find the `snek-itsybitsym0-{version}.uf2` file included in the Snek
package for your machine and copy it to the ItsyBitsy M0 file system.

= Snek on Arduino Mega

Snek for the Mega includes the Common System, EEPROM, Input, GPIO (not
including the `pulldown` function) and math functions. Snek for the
Mega provides pre-defined variables for all of the GPIO
pins:(((Arduino Mega)))

D0-D53::
Digital input and output pins. By default, when used as input pins,
Snek applies a pull-up resistor to the pin so that a disconnected pin
will read as 1. Change this using `pullnone` or `pullup` functions.

A0-A15::
Analog input and Digital output pins. When used as input pins, Snek
will return a value from 0-1 indicating the ratio of the pin voltage
to 5V. By default, when used as input pins, Snek does not apply either
a pull-up or pull-down resistor to the pin so that a disconnected pin
will read an indeterminate value. Change this using `pullnone` or
`pullup` functions.

Snek fits comfortably in the ATmega2560 flash, leaving plenty of
space for the serial boot loader, so re-installing Snek can be done
over USB. However, the default firmware loaded on the ATMega16u2 that
acts as USB to serial converter doesn't do any XON/XOFF flow control
and so that should be replaced before installing Snek as Snekde will
not get or put source code successfully without it.

On Linux, the Snek installation includes a shell script,
snek-mega-install, to install the binary using 'avrdude'. Read the
snek-mega-install manual (also included in the installation) for more
information.

On other hosts, you'll need to install 'avrdude'. Once you've done that,
you can use it to get Snek installed on the device. Because the EEPROM
fuse bit can't be set this way, when you do this any Snek program
stored on the device will be erased. Find out what port the Mega is
connected to, use that as the value for `<port>` and then run 'avrdude' as follows:

= Snek on Lego EV3

Snek for Lego EV3 runs under link:https://www.ev3dev.org/[ev3dev].

The following sensors are supported:

* link:https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/ev3-touch-sensor/45507[Lego EV3
  Touch Sensor],
+
True and False are reported when `read()`.
+
* link:https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/ev3-color-sensor/45506[Lego EV3
  Color Sensor], named "light sensor" in Snek,
+
The sensor can be configured by calling `light_reflected`, `light_ambient`,
`light_color` and `light_rgb` functions.
+
** In `light_reflected` mode the sensor returns intensity of reflected LED
  light, range 0..1. This is the default mode.
** In `light_ambient` mode the sensor returns intensity of ambient light, range
  0..1.
** In `light_color` mode the sensor returns a detected color name, one of
  `'black'`, `'blue'`, `'green'`, `'yellow'`, `'white'`, `'brown'`, or None if
  no object is detected.
** In `light_rgb` mode the sensor returns RGB color tuple of 3 elements, each
component in range 0..1.

* link:https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/ev3-ultrasonic-sensor/45504[
  Lego EV3 Ultrasonic Sensor], named "distance sensor" in Snek.
+
A distance to the object in front of sensor in centimeters is returned, or `Inf`
if no object is detected.

Sensor ports are named 1-4, matching the markings on EV3 body.

Sensors are detected automatically, so they can be plugged/unplugged while Snek
is running.

The following motors are supported:

* link:https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ev3-large-servo-motor-45502[Lego EV3 Large Servo Motor]
* link:https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ev3-medium-servo-motor-45503[Lego EV3 Medium Servo Motor]

Servo motors have two-way communication with the host, so current speed (either
from application of power or from manual rotation) and current position of the
motor can be queried:

* `read` reads the current speed of the motor (-3 to 3 rotations per second),
* `position` reads the current position of the motor (rotations from reset).

Servo motors remember the initial position after reset, so the `position` can
become arbitrarily big.

Current motor to control is selected by using `talkto` with port names
`'A'` to `'D'`.

The following operations are available on the selected motor:

- `setpower` sets the motor speed, from -3 to 3 rotations per second.
- `setleft` makes the motor rotate counterclockwise when positive speed is requested.
- `setright` makes the motor rotate clockwise when positive speed is requested.
- `on` starts the motor
- `off` stops the motor
- `onfor` starts the motor for specified amount of seconds. This function returns
  immediately.
- `setposition` starts the motor it running until it reaches the given position
  (measured in rotations). This function returns immediately.
- `ramp_up` sets the ramp-up time. The argument specifies duration in seconds
  from 0 to maximum speed. If a speed smaller than maximum is requested, ramp-up
  time is shortened proportionally.
- `ramp_down` sets the ramp-down time in the same manner.

Servo motors have several modes for stopping, select them using the following functions:

- `coast`. Once the desired position is reached, remove the power. The motor
  coasts to stop. This is the default mode.
- `brake`. Once the desired position is reached, remove the power and apply
  passive load on the motor. Motor stops quicker than when coasting.
- `hold`. Once the desired position is reached, actively hold the position by
  turning the motor to the desired position.

To run Snek on EV3:

- link:https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/[boot ev3dev],
- link:https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/[connect it to the host],
- Copy `snek-ev3-{version}` to EV3 via `scp`.
